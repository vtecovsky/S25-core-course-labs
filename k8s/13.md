## Pod deletion results

As we can deleted pod was recreated

## Sync status after both tests

Sync Status After Both Tests

1. After Test 1 (Patch Deployment)
The replica count increased.
ArgoCD reported an OutOfSync status.

2. After 2 test (delete pod)
ArgoCD did not detect drift because pod deletions are runtime events, not configuration changes.

## ArgoCD Configuration Drift vs. Runtime Events
ArgoCD differentiates between configuration drift and runtime events, affecting how it reports sync status:

## Configuration Drift
ArgoCD detects and flags changes to resources managed by GitOps.
Examples:
1. Modifying a Deployment spec in Git but not applying it.
2. Changing replica count in Git but not syncing it.
## Runtime Events
1. Events like pod deletions do not cause drift because Kubernetes automatically restores the pod based on the Deployment spec.
2. ArgoCD does not report OutOfSync for these events since they do not change the desired state in Git.
