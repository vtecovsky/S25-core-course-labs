# **CI Workflow** üöÄ  

My **Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline** is designed to ensure code quality, reliability, and smooth deployment. The workflow is triggered whenever changes are made to the `app_go/` directory.

## **Pipeline Overview**  
The CI process consists of three key jobs:  

### üîç **1. Linting** 
- Uses **Golangci-lint** to enforce coding standards and detect potential issues.
- Ensures that the code follows Go best practices and is free from linting errors.

### üß™ **2. Testing**
- Runs **Go test** to validate the correctness of the application.
- Ensures all tests pass before proceeding to the next stage.

### üì¶ **3. Build & Push**
This step prepares and deploys the application using Docker:  
1. **Login** ‚Äì Authenticates with Docker Hub.
2. **Build** ‚Äì Creates a Docker image of the application.
3. **Push** ‚Äì Uploads the built image to the container registry.
